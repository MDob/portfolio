The Nanoplasmonics Research Group at the University of Victoria is supervised by Professor Reuven Gordon. The group focusses on nanoaperture optical trapping using double nanoholes. This technique was first developed by Professor Gordon and is now used by many optical trapping groups around the world. The group's research is split between quantum computing applications using erbium-doped nanocrystals and protein analysis for biological and drug discovery applications.
