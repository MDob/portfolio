  abstract = {This thesis presents a route towards a single photon source based on erbium-doped  nanocrystals, fabricated with methods that use double nanohole optical tweezers.  Single photon sources are an exciting quantum technology and erbium is good candidate  as it emits in the low-loss fiber optic C-band, but it is a weak emitter. Double  nanohole apertures can be designed with plasmonic resonances to enhance the local  electric field. In this thesis, double nanohole optical tweezers are used to isolate  and enhance the emission of erbium-doped nanocrystals, with the tuned geometry  showing a factor of 50 additional enhancement over rectangular apertures. With  the enhanced emission, nanocrystals with discrete levels of erbium emitters are detected  and isolated in real-time, based on their level of emission. This real-time process  demonstrates a major improvement over typical post-processing approaches.    A novel method to anchor nanocrystals in a double nanohole using a photochemical  thiol reaction was investigated which yielded 40\% of nanoparticles anchoring  within 2 {$\mu$}m of the DNH, with 5\% inside. This is useful as otherwise the  trapping laser must be maintained to keep the nanocrystal in the trap. Another  challenge is coupling to an optical fiber, for which a method to combine trapping  and coupling was explored. Colloidal pattern transfer is presented as a low-cost  fabrication method for nanoaperture optical fiber tweezers, with fiber-based trapping  demonstrated using 40 nm polystyrene nanospheres and hexagonal boron  nitride. The preliminary results from these methods show great potential, and  with further refinement they may lead towards a method to fabricate a low-cost  fiber-coupled single photon source based on erbium-doped nanocrystals.},
