abstract: Here we use optical trapping to isolate single Yb/Er-doped upconversion nanocrystals in plasmonic double nanohole apertures and show that the geometry of the aperture can be tuned to give high emission rate enhancement. The double nanohole apertures show additional enhancement over the rectangular apertures that were previously demonstrated by our group, producing enough enhancement to observe emission at 400 nm and 1550 nm with 980 nm excitation—not seen in our group’s previous work with rectangular apertures. A facile method for tuning the geometry of double nanohole apertures by adjusting the plasma etching time in the colloidal lithography fabrication process is discussed. We find that a double nanohole with a cusp separation of 32 nm yields the greatest emission enhancement with multiple plasmonic resonances which enhance both the excitation and emission wavelengths. The emission enhancement for the DNH with 32 nm cusp separation was found to be a factor of 54, 44, and 31 greater than the rectangular apertures used in our group’s previous work, for wavelengths of 650 nm, 550 nm, and 400 nm. This result shows that double nanohole apertures can be tuned for emission enhancement as required by specific applications.
