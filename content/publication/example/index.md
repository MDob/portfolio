abstract: Single-photon sources are required for quantum technologies and can be
  created from individual atoms and atom-like defects. Erbium ions produce
  single photons at low-loss fiber optic wavelengths, but they have low emission
  rates, making them challenging to isolate reliably. Here, we tune the size of
  gold double nanoholes (DNHs) to enhance the emission of single erbium
  emitters, achieving 50Ã— enhancement over rectangular apertures previously
  demonstrated. This produces enough enhancement to show emission from single
  nanocrystals at wavelengths not seen in our previous work, i.e., 400 and 1550
  nm. We observe discrete levels of emission for nanocrystals with low numbers
  of emitters and demonstrate isolating single emitters. We describe how the
  trapping time is proportional to the enhancement factor for a given DNH
  structure, giving us an independent way to measure the enhancement. This shows
  a promising path to achieving single emitter sources at 1550 nm.
