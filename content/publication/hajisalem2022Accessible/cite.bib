  abstract = {Nanohole optical tweezers have been used by several groups to trap and analyze proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to create high-performance double nanohole (DNH) substrates for trapping proteins without the need for any top-down approaches (such as electron microscopy or focused-ion beam milling). Using polarization analysis, we identify DNHs as well as determine their orientation and then use them for trapping. We are also able to identify other hole configurations, such as single, trimers and other clusters. We explore changing the substrate from glass to polyvinyl chloride to enhance trapping ability, showing 7 times lower minimum trapping power, which we believe is due to reduced surface repulsion. Finally, we present tape exfoliation as a means to expose DNHs without damaging sonication or chemical methods. Overall, these approaches make high quality optical trapping using DNH structures accessible to a broad scientific community.},
