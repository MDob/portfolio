abstract: Single-photon sources are required for quantum technologies and can be created from individual atoms and atom-like defects. Erbium ions produce single photons at low-loss fiber optic wavelengths, but they have low emission rates, making them challenging to isolate reliably. Here, we tune the size of gold double nanoholes (DNHs) to enhance the emission of single erbium emitters, achieving 50Ã— enhancement over rectangular apertures previously demonstrated. This produces enough enhancement to show emission from single nanocrystals at wavelengths not seen in our previous work, i.e., 400 and 1550 nm. We observe discrete levels of emission for nanocrystals with low numbers of emitters and demonstrate isolating single emitters. We describe how the trapping time is proportional to the enhancement factor for a given DNH structure, giving us an independent way to measure the enhancement. This shows a promising path to achieving single emitter sources at 1550 nm.

summary: Plasmon-enhanced optical trapping was used to isolate nanocrystals with discrete levels of erbium ions. These levels were detected by observing discrete levels of emission from the erbium ions. Future work will investigate nanocrystals containing single erbium ions as single-photon sources.
